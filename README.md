# Named_Entity_Recognition

Brief Summary
For this project, we are tasked with a Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. NER is a key subtask of NLP that is used in many areas such as news classification and search algorithms. We are provided with a dataset of 66,161 words along with a labeled Named Entity, if applicable. Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem.

The dataset is an Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition using GMB(Groningen Meaning Bank) corpus

The analysis starts with a data preparation phase consisting of data cleaning, data exploration/visualization, and feature engineering. While the modeling phase explores a variety of algorithms such as Gradient Boosting and simple Neural Nets, Support Vector Machines (SVM) became the focus of the modeling, as they scale well to many dimensions and are therefore efficient for text-based classification. Our final model resulted in an overall accuracy score of 96% on data unseen during the modeling process.
